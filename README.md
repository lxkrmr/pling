# pling

A reaction game. Cards appear, hit the button when you spot exactly 5 of a kind.

## What is this?

A prototype. Minimal. Vanilla JS + HTML.

**The question:** What's possible? How does it feel?

## Why?

- Try ideas before they grow big
- Learn by doing
- Find the shortest path to something playable

## The Game

Cards appear automatically. Count them. When you see exactly 5 of a kind: **PLING!**

- **Hit the button at the right moment** → Points
- **Too early or wrong** → Penalty

One button. Maximum focus.

## Tech

- Single HTML file
- No framework, no build tools
- Runs in the browser (desktop + mobile)

## Try it

**Online:** [Link coming when deployed]

**Locally:**
```bash
git clone [url]
cd pling

python3 -m http.server 8080

open http://localhost:8080
```
