## How to play

- Cards appear on 3 stacks, one by one
- Each card shows 1–4 symbols (●, ■, ▲)
- Count the symbols across all visible cards
- See exactly **5 of a kind**? Hit **PLING!**
- Wrong press → lose a heart
- 3 hearts → game over

## Philosophy

- No sounds – play alongside music or podcasts
- No dark patterns, no ads, no tracking
- One button. Maximum focus.

## Accessibility

Designed with color blindness in mind – no red/green distinction for game feedback.
Correct and wrong are shown in **blue** and **orange** instead.

Inspired by the [GitHub Dark Colorblind theme](https://github.com/settings/appearance).
